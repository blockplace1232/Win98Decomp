# Win98Decomp
All the files for the APK are available for use and modification as you see fit.

The code for this project was originally written by LR-Soft; however, their project on the Google Play Store was recently taken down.

In addition to providing the original code here, I also have a download for the APK on the "Win98" repository.
I highly recommend checking out this simulator app if you haven't already.
